# GitHub Setup Guide (Mobile Friendly)

## Option 1: Using Replit's GitHub Integration (Easiest)

### Step 1: Connect Replit to GitHub
1. In your Replit app, go to Settings (gear icon)
2. Look for "GitHub" or "Version Control" 
3. Connect your GitHub account

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
1. In Replit, look for "Version Control" or "Git" option
2. Click "Create GitHub Repository"
3. Name it: `code-explanation-app`
4. Click "Create Repository"

This will automatically push all your files to GitHub!

## Option 2: Manual Method (If Option 1 doesn't work)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to github.com/dawnenakey on your phone
2. Tap "New repository"
3. Name: `code-explanation-app`
4. Make it public
5. Don't add README (we have one)
6. Create repository

### Step 2: Get the Files
Since you're on mobile, you'll need to:

1. **Share the Replit link** with someone who can help, or
2. **Use GitHub's web interface** to upload files manually, or
3. **Wait until you're on a computer** to run git commands

## Option 3: Download and Upload (Mobile Backup)

### Step 1: Download Project
1. In Replit, look for "Download" or "Export" option
2. Download the project as a ZIP file

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to your new GitHub repository
2. Use "Upload files" button
3. Upload the ZIP contents

## What You'll Have on GitHub

Your repository will contain:
- `README.md` - Complete project documentation
- `client/` - React frontend with comprehensive testing
- `server/` - Express backend with PostgreSQL
- `shared/` - TypeScript schemas and models
- `ANGULAR_TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` - Angular testing guide
- `BACKBASE_ANGULAR_TESTING.md` - Backbase-specific testing
- `QA_PRACTICAL_EXAMPLE.md` - QA testing examples
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

## For Your Team

Once it's on GitHub, your team can:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dawnenakey/code-explanation-app.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run QA tests
npx vitest run client/src/__tests__/qa/
```

## Need Help?

If you're stuck, you can:
1. Ask a team member with computer access to help
2. Use Replit's built-in GitHub integration
3. Contact me when you're on a computer for git commands

The key is getting the files from Replit to GitHub - the method depends on what options Replit provides in their mobile app.
