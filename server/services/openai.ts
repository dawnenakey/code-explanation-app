Code:

${code}

Please respond with a JSON object containing:
- explanation: A clear overview of what the code does
- detectedLanguage: The actual programming language detected (be specific, e.g., "Python", "JavaScript", "Java")
- keyPoints: Array of 3-5 key points about the code
- stepByStep: Array of objects with step, description, and color fields for step-by-step breakdown
- concepts: Array of objects with name and description for key programming concepts used
- performanceNotes: Performance analysis and optimization suggestions
- optimizationSuggestions: Array of objects with issue, solution, and example fields for specific improvements
- complexityAnalysis: Object with timeComplexity, spaceComplexity, and analysis fields

Focus on:
1. Educational explanations for beginners
2. Algorithmic complexity analysis (Big O notation)
3. Specific optimization recommendations with examples
4. Data structure efficiency suggestions
5. Common performance pitfalls and solutions

For optimization suggestions, provide specific examples like:
- "This loop has O(nÂ²) complexity. Consider using a HashMap to reduce it to O(n)"
- "Linear search is inefficient. Use binary search for sorted arrays"
- "Recursive approach may cause stack overflow. Consider iterative solution"
- "Multiple array iterations can be combined into a single loop"

Be specific about data structure choices and algorithmic improvements.`;
